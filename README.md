# Logo

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grunnjs/logo/master/logo.png"
align="right" />

The GrunnJS logo based on the coat of arms of Groningen (city). The coat of arms
consists of a dual headed eagle holding a white shield with a green stripe. This
coat of arms can be found at various of location in the city. Once of the most
popular locations can be found in the Martinikerk on the organ. Or if you're
a student in Groningen you recognize this from the RUG (university) which also
has the eagle embedded in a shield as logo.

The logo that we're using is influenced by these designs. But colored by using
the same colors as the [logo.js](https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js)
project.
